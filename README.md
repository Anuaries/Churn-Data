The data (churn.csv) is from a bank and contains the clients churn data over a particular banking product category. 
The data collected revolves around the risk type, the age, the family dependent indicator, the income levels and health condition with reference 
to whether the client churns (unsubscribe) from the product.

I have used the Logistic Regression Model to test and train the data. The output shows a 76% accuracy when compared to the test data. This can be further improved if we get more data in general or more labels in addition to age, risk_type,dependents, income and health.
